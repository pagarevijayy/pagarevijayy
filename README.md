Hi 👋 I'm Vijay Pagare
======================

Senior Software Engineer focused on building AI-enabled, high-performance web systems that power real-world products.

With 6+ years of experience, I specialize in crafting scalable, accessible B2B SaaS platforms with strong UX foundations and performance at their core. My work spans React, Angular, AEM, and data-intensive interfaces — leading architectural improvements, UI/UX modernization, and measurable performance gains across analytics, healthcare, and fintech domains.

I care deeply about product thinking — not just shipping features, but improving user journeys, system efficiency, and business outcomes.

Alongside my full-time role, I’m pursuing an MTech at BITS Pilani, expanding my focus toward AI-driven systems and scalable web architecture.
